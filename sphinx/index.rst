What is :math:`{\boldsymbol k}`Â Quant?
======================================

There are multiple situations where researchers create Hamiltonian models in the momentum space 
by exploiting the Bloch's theorem, symmetries, and intuition. However, a Hamiltonian is just the first step
in long journey towards generating quantitative predictions of measurable quantities. ``k-quant`` is
a high-level Python package which aims to provide an many different functions to compute
spectral properties from the Hamiltonian such as bandstructures and their spin and orbital projections, 
conductivities, spin Hall conductivities, and density of states.
